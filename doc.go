// Package gentools contains Golang tools used for scanning and parsing golang code.
// It is based on the golang `ast` and provides simple but very powerful functionality in terms of code scanning.
//
// The API is expected to be simpler and less verbose than `go/types` package, that looks more like `reflect`.
